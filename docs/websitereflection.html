        <h2>Website Reflection</h2>
        <p>In DIGIT 100 we have had the opportunity to make two different sites. One used oxygen and
            html while uploading to GitHub to create the website. The other used PSU sites. I have
            found the PSU sites the easier of the two to use. It is much easier to type text, add
            links, and add pictures too than the oxygen code. However, I think if I were using this
            more long term than the oxygen code would be better to continue using. It allows for
            more customization and ways to show off your coding skills.</p>
