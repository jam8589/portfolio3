        <h2>Website Reflection</h2>
        <p>In DIGIT 100 we have had the opportunity to make two different sites. One used GitHub
            Pages and the other used PSU WordPress.</p>
        <p>For new learners, the most significant challenge with GitHub Pages was understanding how
            to work with code, especially HTML and CSS. Managing repositories on GitHub can be
            overwhelming for someone unfamiliar with programming and web development. On the other
            hand, PSU WordPress is much more user-friendly for beginners. It uses a drag-and-drop
            editor with intuitive controls, allowing users to create pages without coding knowledge.
            However, there is some limitations with customization and themes.</p>
        <p>As for advantages, GitHub Pages offers more flexibility and control over your site, if
            you are comfortable with coding. You can customize every aspect of the site. As for PSU
            WordPress it has advantages in simplicity and accessibility. It allows users to quickly
            set up a website without worrying about technical details. The built-in templates,
            themes, and plugins make it easy to add features.</p>
        <p>Challenges in modifying layout and organization seem to be more present with GitHub
            pages. Layout and organization in GitHub pages requires a strong knowledge of HTML and
            CSS, and since everything is code based you have to edit every file directly which can
            be time-consuming. As for PSU WordPress, the layout changes are much more
            straightforward and the block editor can allow you to rearrange elements without any
            coding. However, WordPress's themes can be restrictive. Certain themes limit how much
            you can alter the layout without developing custom CSS.</p>
        <p>GitHub Pages requires the necessary skills of Git and GitHub version control as well as
            HTML, CSS, and basic coding and command-line usage. As for WordPress you need to know
            how to navigate its themes, dashboard, and block editor. It could require some knowledge
            of HTML and CSS but not necessarily depending on the level of customization.</p>
        <p>In order to improve my skills I need to dive deeper into my formatting and CSS code, as
            well as customizing my themes.</p>
        <p>Both GitHub Pages and PSU WordPress offer unique advantages depending on the user's needs
            and experience. I have found the PSU WordPress to be the easier of the two to use. It is
            much easier than GitHub pages to type text, add links, and add pictures. However, I
            think if I were using this more long term, than the GitHub Pages would be better to
            continue using. It allows for more customization and ways to show off your coding
            skills.</p>
